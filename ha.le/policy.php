						<h5>Shipping and Delivery</h5>
						<p>Since ChicHaus items are custom-made, please allow 8-16 weeks for processing after your purchase. We ship orders from Monday to Sundays. We partner with reliable third-party carriers like UPS, DHL, FedEx, and Parcel Force to ensure timely delivery of your order.

						<p>All online orders are shipped with a trackable service. You will receive the tracking information via email once your items are dispatched. Estimated delivery times are based on the shipping method you select at checkout and your shipping address. While we strive to meet these estimates, please be aware that unforeseen delays can occasionally occur. </p>

						<p>If your package is marked as delivered but you haven't received it, please contact us immediately. We will work with the shipping carrier to investigate the issue.</p>

						<h5>Returns</h5>
						<p>Since your ChicHaus items are crafted specifically for you, returns for a full refund are not possible. However, ChicHaus offers a store credit of 50% of the purchase price. We understand that plans can change! You can cancel your order for a full refund within 24 hours of placing it by contacting our customer service team by phone or email. </p>

						<p> To be eligible for a return (even for a partial refund), you must request it within 5 days of receiving your order. Please include your order reference number. Once we receive your written return confirmation, you'll have 14 days to return the unused items in their original packaging.</p>
